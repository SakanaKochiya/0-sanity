    "siege": "Verna, codenamed 'Siege', leader of the Glasgow (a squad of former street punks), has a fierce and reckless battle style.  Her natural command, courage, and composure have made her one of the most sought-after Vanguards at Rhodes Island. Siege is a well rounded DP-Recovery and DPS Vanguard.\nSiege has two forms of DP-Recovery. Charge ùù≤ is the standard passive DP-Recovery Skill that provides DP over time.  Her second Skill, however, is what makes Siege stand out as the Leader of the Vanguard Pack.  Aerial Hammer deals huge physical AoE damage to adjacent enemies and instantly provides 3 DP.  With 3 charges at max level, a very low SP cost, and supercharged by her Talent, this is the core of Siege's DPS and DP-Recovery engine and is her most commonly used Skill. Her 3rd Skill, Skull Crusher, takes the VAN out of Vanguard, and turns Siege into a Guard with a damage buff and a stun, at the cost of an increased Attack Interval. Although it allows her to fare much better against strong enemies, there is no DP Recovery with this Skill, which is generally what Vanguards are relied on to provide.\nSiege's very high HP and Defense stats make her one of the most durable Vanguards, but this also contributes to one of her biggest weaknesses: she has a much higher deployment cost relative to lower rarity operators who fill a similar role.   Once deployed, however, Siege is a complete-package Vanguard that provides high DP-Recovery, strong AoE damage, and excellent defense, which will be well worth her higher DP cost. This lion will roar on any battlefield.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 2251\nAtk: 515\nDef: 384\nRes: 0\nDP: 14\nBlock: 2\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,05s\n\nRecommended skill: Aerial Hammer (Skill 2)",

Reduce enemies weight, expand attack range and attack multiple enemies is what made her third skill shine. When remaining idle, she can heal all other operators, including enmity ones, with her second Talent.

She is especially good at changing the enemies she targets based on what you need her to do.\nFinding an isolated deployment spot to activate second Talent can be difficult on some maps, and first Talent doesn't give much bonus damage against enemies with low DEF. Despite this, Ceobe is an absolute wrecking ball at destroying high-DEF enemies, which is usually the most important task for a ST Caster to fulfill.

As the branch is plagued with issues such as limited utility, poor range, and awful attack speed, Dusk's competitiveness against even the best of the casters is even more impressive. Dusk brings a strong, versatile kit that performs much better than the rest of her branch peers.\nHer most notable stat difference is her much considerably higher ATK stat compared to the rest of her branch. It helps set her up to be a better damage dealer, alongside a kit that allows her to make the most out of her scaling ATK.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 1801\nAtk: 918\nDef: 127\nRes: 20\nDP: 34\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 2,9s\nRecommended skill: Transcendental Stroke (Skill 1)",

Along with her trait that allows her to deal damage twice with each attack, what makes Chen so unique is the variety and effectiveness of her Skills.  Her role in battle changes based on the Skill she uses, and she is solid at all of them. \nChen's greatest weakness is that she pays for her amazing Skills by only being able to charge them when she is attacking.  Although her Talent does soften the blow, it can be frustrating during breaks in battle watching Ch'en get no closer to her next Skill use while other Operators are charging.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 2880\nAtk: 610\nDef: 352\nRes: 0\nDP: 23\nBlock: 2\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,3s\n\nRecommended skill: Chi Xiao - Unsheath",

Blaze costs a lot of DP to deploy, and she doesn't hit her full power until E2-promotion, which is when she finally gains Block-3 and can attack 3 enemies simultaneously. As a 6‚òÖ unit, this costs a lot of resources. However, rest assured that Blaze will pay back this investment in spades.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 2821\nAtk: 765\nDef: 370\nRes: 0\nDP: 24\nBlock: 3\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,2s\n\nRecommended skill: Chainsaw Extension Module (Skill 2)",
    "kal": "Kal'tsit is a Healer Medic who ironically does a poor job at healing. She is more akin to a guard operator thanks to her summon, Mon3tr, which her entire kit is built around. If you are in need of a powerful healer, using Kal will only lead to disappointment. Despite that, she is one of the best DPS operators in the game with her lane holding capabilities and powerful true damage bursts. She is easy to use for beginners and has a high skill ceiling, staying relevant even in the hardest content in the game. She will be a great addition to any player's roster.\nKal's stats are nothing special, being essentially what should be expected from her archetype. Most notably though is that, unlike the rest of her archetype, she has an entire extra row of range that is quite helpful in allowing her to reach further.

Her third skill, Holiday storm, is very effective for mobs cleaning, crowd control and boss killing. A pack of debuffs (Def reduction, speed reduction) and buffs (attack increase, front row +150% from trait) is what made this skill really shine.But not all operator are completely flawless. Chalter suffer from a slow attack speed and high DP cost, just behind Mudrock and Passenger, in which can cause postioning operators against high attack ranged enemies like Faust a big problem.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 2501\nAtk: 773\nDef: 203\nRes: 0\nDP: 32\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 2,3s\n\nRecommended skill: ‚ÄúHoliday Storm‚Äù (Skill 3)",
    "godsenger": "Passenger, 6‚òÖ Chain Caster Operator, skilled at AoE damage and rapidfire Slow effects.The array of complex machinery that Passenger wields is the source of the ‚Äúchain lightning‚Äù Arts attacks of his archetype. These attacks bounce between multiple enemies (though they do not return to a target they have already hit), doing less damage with each bounce and inflicting a minor Slow effect.\nPassenger has a reputation for being a very weak 6‚òÖ Operator. In general, the Chain Caster archetype has struggled to find a niche between the power of ST Casters and the better area control of AoE Casters, especially with high DP cost, slow ASPD, the brief duration of their Slow effect, and reliance on enemy positioning dragging them down. Passenger suffers extra roadblocks from his high SP costs and the many clunky aspects of his S3. It takes particular enemy positioning or lots of help from other Operators for Passenger to take center stage.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 1558\nAtk: 611\nDef: 130\nRes: 20\nDP: 33\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 2,3s\n\nRecommended skill: Glorious Shards (Skill 3)",
    "kya": "As a 6‚òÖ Duelist Guard, Skadi specializes in DPS and Survival. Her Skill 2, Wave Strike, gives her a massive Attack buff for a short time right after she is deployed. This Skill is perfect for assassinating unarmored targets. Skill 3, Tidal Elegy, turns Skadi into an unstoppable juggernaut with boosted HP, Attack, and Defense. This Skill makes Skadi virtually invincible: your enemies will break upon her like waves upon the shore. Tidal Elegy is very expensive, so don't expect to use it several times in one fight, but it starts off with a huge chunk of SP, making it easy to use soon after Skadi is deployed.\nSkadi has one of the highest ATK and HP stats in Arknights, but the same can't be said for her Defense. She is more on the fragile side when it comes to taking hits, despite her huge health pool. Along with only being able to Block-1, Skadi clearly excels at attacking rather than defending.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 3665\nAtk: 933\nDef: 263\nRes: 0\nDP: 19\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,5s\n\nRecommended skill: Tidal Elegy (Skill 3)",
    "mudrock": "Mudrock is a powerful Enimity Defender packing very strong offensive and defensive capabilities. She has the highest DP cost in the game, but makes up for it with an extremely high power ceiling, being able to take on most enemies in the game. She's useful pretty much anywhere, and can be considered one of the most powerful operators in the entire game. Her only real downside is needing the DP to put her down.\nMudrock's stats are very high as per the archetype, with a huge HP pool, strong ATK and DEF stats, and 3-block that more than make up for having the highest upfront DP cost of any operator in the game. She scales very well with additional levels, as her high stat growth contributes to all of her aspects including self-sustainability. Her archetype trait is that she cannot be directly healed by allies. However, this does not mean that she cannot be healed at all, as ‚Äúregeneration‚Äù type heals will still work just fine on her - same as any other operator with a similar trait.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 3928\nAtk: 882\nDef: 602\nRes: 10\nDP: 36\nBlock: 3\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,6s\n\nRecommended skill: Crag Splitter (Skill 2)",
    "shining":"Shining is a 6‚òÖ single-target Medic who specializes in powerful healing and DEF support.\nHer Talent, Black Fiend's Protection, as well as her second and third Skill, all provide DEF buffs to her allies. Auto-Protect places a temporary shield on Shining's healing target, increasing the Operator's DEF and absorbing damage for a short time. The Skill also holds multiple charges as it levels, so Shining can build charges of Auto-Protect between enemy waves to blunt the next wave's initial assault. Her third Skill, Creed Field, greatly increases the DEF of allies in her range for a considerable amount of time. This Skill can be used quickly after deployment, has a long duration, and provides a considerable boost to healing strength, making it a great burst option for emergency situations or when fighting bosses. If the Doctor wants to use Shining in a non-DEF situation, her first Skill, Creed, significantly increases her healing power and gives her a small speed bonus.\nShining is a premier tank healer, and her DEF-enhancing support is great against most enemies in the game. Combined with her ability to quickly throw out very large heals, she excels at keeping frontline Operators alive. Her amazing abilities come at a cost, though--specifically, her DP cost, which is quite high. It should also be noted that Shining's DEF buffs do nothing against enemies who deal Arts damage.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 1613\nAtk: 530\nDef: 138\nRes: 0\nDP: 20\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 2,85s\n\nRecommended skill: Creed Field (Skill 3)",
    "nightingale":"Nightingale is a 6‚òÖ AoE Medic who can restore the HP of 3 allies simultaneously and specializes in protecting her teammates with Arts Resistance buffs and her `Fleeting Phantom`s. \nNightingale's first Talent, White Fiend's Protection, as well as her Arts Shield and Sanctuary Skills, all increase the RES of your Operators in different ways. Her second Talent, Fleeting Phantom, enables some interesting strategic play, as it creates phantoms that she can place on the map to draw enemy fire. These phantoms cannot attack or block, but they have high RES and Arts Dodge, giving your team extra breathing room in tight situations.\nNightingale is primarily a preventative healer who may, in some situations, underperform compared to lower-rarity Medics, especially when there is no Arts damage involved. While AoE healers are important team members, other AoE healers are arguably less niche than Nightingale, especially given their significantly reduced investment requirements compared to the 6‚òÖ. That being said, AoE Arts mitigation is extremely rare, and it absolutely trivializes any enemy that deals Arts damage. Since enemy Casters and their ilk tend to be extremely nasty, there are many situations where Nightingale's unique powers get a chance to sing.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 1705\nAtk: 350\nDef: 169\nRes: 5\nDP: 18\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 2,85s\n\nRecommended skill: Sanctuary (Skill 3)",
    "ifrit": "Ifrit is a 6‚òÖ AoE Caster who is notable for her DPS, her flat stat Debuffs, and her unusual attack range, where she damages all enemies in a long line straight from her position. Everything about Ifrit is meant to send your enemies straight to the crematorium. Her first Talent, Spiritual Dissolution, decreases the RES of enemies within her attack range, while her E2 Talent, Rhine Loop, increases her rate of SP gain. Together, these Talents give Ifrit some monstrous DPS potential that is multiplied by her Skills.\nScorched Earth (Skill 3) temporarily transforms Ifrit's regular attack into more of an ‚Äúaura‚Äù that deals Arts damage to enemies every second and further decreases their RES, making it better for burning down bosses and benefiting allied Casters. However, this Skill causes Ifrit to lose HP while it is active and cannot hit aerial enemies, so it must be used wisely. Pyroclasm (Skill 2) increases the damage of her next attack and causes it to inflict a flat DEF debuff and a burn effect that deals damage over time. This Skill greatly enhances the damage of physical Operators on her team and is generally the preferred Skill.\nIn fact, ‚Äúmust be used wisely‚Äù is a good rule of thumb for Ifrit in general. Her straight-line attack range is not easy to utilize on all maps and her Skills work best when the rest of her team is tailored around them. She also suffers from the usual disadvantages of AoE Casters: her attack speed is slow, she is very fragile, and deploying her is very expensive. The payoff is worth it, however; her DPS is insane and flat stat debuffs are quite uncommon in Arknights. Provide the fuel for Ifrit's flamethrower and she will put it to very, very good use.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 1680\nAtk: 870\nDef: 130\nRes: 20\nDP: 34\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 2,9s\n\nRecommended skill: Scorched Earth (Skill 3) or Pyroclasm (Skill 2)",
    "eyja": "Eyjafjalla is a powerful single target Caster who can deal AoE damage. Her Oripathy infection, presumably due to research near volcanic areas and exposure to particles with Originium, impairs her hearing and other senses. Eyjafjalla's fantastic kit can obliterate bosses and multiple targets alike. Her first skill, Duetto, is an Attack Speed Increase, which is also an ATK Increase after the first cast.\nIgnition, her second skill, lets her do great Area of Effect damage and decrease enemies' Resistance.  It does excellent consistent DPS to both single targets and groups, making it her most commonly used Skill.  Her final Skill, Volcano, increases damage, range, attack speed, and number of targets by a considerable amount. It does extremely high damage, and can melt down groups and bosses alike.  It's short duration and long cooldown, however, can leave you flat in between uses.  To top off her amazing Skills, her Talent, Pyrobreath, buffs the ATK of all Casters on the field when she is deployed.\nEyjafjalla has the Deployment Cost of a single target Caster with AoE Damage potential that rivals the best AoE Casters. This makes Eyj a strong Caster choice in almost all situations.  Float this cute little Caster onto the battlefield and enjoy watching things melt.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 1743\nAtk: 645\nDef: 122\nRes: 20\nDP: 21\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,6s\n\nRecommended skill: Volcano (Skill 3)",
    "exu": "As a single target Sniper, Exusiai's main role in the team is providing DPS in the early stage of a mission and taking down airborne units. Her specialty is dealing large amounts of damage through multi-hit attacks, which elevates her ability to take down low armor, high HP targets like most bosses. All of her skills center around fast multi-hit attacks. Her first skill Charging Mode automatically deals 3 strengthened hits to a single enemy every few attacks, which makes it a great choice when sustained DPS is required. The second skill Shooting Mode is a short damage burst with a manual trigger. This allows players to save the skill for a stronger wave of enemies when higher damage is needed.\nHer third and last skill, Overloading Mode, is another short but powerful burst of attacks that additionally increases Exusiai's attack speed. This skill is activated automatically, which means it could trigger when there are no enemies around, resulting in wasted damage potential. Despite that, having a high hit multiplier and low charge time make it the go-to skill when deploying Exusiai.Outside of her generally high performance, Exusiai does have a few weaknesses.  With her relatively low ATK, she will have trouble taking down heavily armored enemies, as damage for multi-hit attacks are calculated individually.  That being said, Exusiai is a very flexible single target Sniper who will send many an enemy to apple-pie-heaven with her sustained or burst DPS.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 1673\nAtk: 540\nDef: 161\nRes: 0\nDP: 14\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1s\n\nRecommended skill: Overloading Mode (Skill 3)",

SilverAsh is a very versatile Guard, having strong defensive and offensive options as well as useful Talents.  Using SilverAsh optimally requires players to plan ahead and know when to activate his Skills, especially in later stages, but his amazing abilities will change your game forever.\nSilverAsh's third Skill Truesilver Slash is the most powerful in his arsenal, and is what SA memes are made of. It reduces Defense but greatly increases his attack and attack range. When this skill is active, SilverAsh's attacks will deal death to multiple enemies and the ranged attack penalty won't be applied. While this Skill turns him into an AoE damage monster with a relatively long uptime, the Defense penalty and long cool-down means it must be used carefully.  Another part of his kit that should not be ignored is his second Talent Eagle Eyes, which removes Invisibility from enemies, allowing them to be taken down much faster and easier.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 2560\nAtk: 713\nDef: 397\nRes: 10\nDP: 20\nBlock: 2\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,3s\n\nRecommended skill: Truesilver Slash (Skill 3) or Rule of Survival (Skill 2)",

Hoshiguma's first Talent, Tactical Armor, grants her a chance to resist both physical and arts damage. Her first Skill, Warpath, provides a standard Defense and Attack buff. Her second skill, Thorns, is a passive Skill that grants her a slight Defense buff and deals a portion of her Attack in physical damage to all enemies that attack her. In particular, this Skill fills a niche when dealing with invisible ranged enemies at a distance, as these enemies cannot normally be attacked by other Operators without first being blocked, or by having a rare detection Skill/Talent.\nHoshiguma's third Skill, Saw of Strength, turns her into a literal grinder, allowing her to attack all enemies in front of her while simultaneously granting large buffs to her Attack and Defense. This Skill allows Hoshiguma to quickly deal with large groups of enemies, significantly decreasing the burden on your defensive line.\nHoshiguma is a very straightforward Defender Operator, but this is also her greatest weakness. She excels at being an effective tank that also deals good damage, but does not provide much unique support or utility outside of her second Talent, Special Operation, which grants a slight Defense buff to all other Defenders. Despite having a niche use for dealing with invisible ranged enemies, Hoshiguma does not fill many other irreplaceable roles.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 3850\nAtk: 430\nDef: 723\nRes: 0\nDP: 23\nBlock: 3\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,2s\n\nRecommended skill: Saw of Strength (Skill 3)",
    "daddy_saria":"Saria is a 6‚òÖ Healing Defender who heals as much as a Medic, destroys enemies with her powerful debuffs, and even generates SP for her allies. It was mentioned in Arknights lore that Saria holds the record for fewest casualties on her watch. This is pretty much clear in terms of gameplay, too. The amount of healing Saria can output with her Skills is incredibly impressive for a non-Medic Operator. Her S1, First Aid, automatically heals a nearby ally when they fall below half HP, and it stores multiple charges. On the other extreme is her Medicine Dispensing S2, which is an automatic AoE healing Skill. Medicine Dispensing does not have an HP threshold nor charges, but it heals a sizable amount of HP over a wide range on a short cooldown, making it very useful on maps with Red Haze (poison mist).\nFinally there's Calcification, an S3 of terrifying power. Calcification is a manually-activated Skill that debilitates all enemies across a huge area down to their very bones, reducing their movement speed and increasing the amount of Arts damage they take. (These are both unique debuffs, so they stack with other Slows and RES debuffs!) And that's not all: any allies in Calcification's range are constantly healed for the duration.\nShe's a shining star for Challenge maps and Contingency Contract events, especially when Medics are banned, and her solid durability combined with Block-3 means she is perfectly able to soak hits from enemies while she keeps her allies healthy. Her S2 does lose its luster in harder content, but with S1 and S3 to fall back on, Saria always has something useful to do. Between her healing, her survivability, and her debuffs, there's no question that Saria is the keystone for any formation she is a part of.\n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 3150\nAtk: 485\nDef: 595\nRes: 10\nDP: 22\nBlock: 3\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,2s\n\nRecommended skill: First Aid (Skill 1) or Medicine Dispensing (Skill 2)    ",
    "schwarz":"Schwarz might be one of the more powerful dedicated boss-killer units in Arknights as a 6* Close Range Sniper, and it's worth appreciating\nHer Skill 1, Charged Shot, is an auto skill that increases the chance dramatically and adds a large ATK buff every few shots, making it great for consistent damage output. Her Skill 2, Sharp Eye, grants less of an ATK and Talent activation buff, but every shot during its duration gains the effect, making it better for burst or heavy-action periods. With its SP cost and duration, this skill has great up-time. Her Skill 3, Final Tactics, however, is where Schwarz gains her reputation. It changes her attack range to a long, narrow line (who's Close Range now, bitch?!) and gives a 100% chance to trigger her Talent, guaranteeing huge numbers with every shot. This Skill also charges ridiculously quickly, has great up-time for how powerful it is, and packs a huge ATK buff in the bargain. Even though it does force her to attack straight ahead, which can limit her deployment, it is still her marquee Skill.\nWhile Schwarz can become one of the most potent boss-killers in Arknights, she does have limitations you'll have to work around, mostly in terms of deploying her. As a Close Range Sniper, her DP cost is extremely high compared to standard Anti-Air Snipers, and choosing a good position for her is difficult due to her short default range and her very specific S3 range. \n\nStats(Elite 2 lvl 90, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 1833\nAtk: 840\nDef: 225\nRes: 0\nDP: 20\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,6s\n\nRecommended skill: Final Tactics (Skill 3) or Sharp Eye (Skill 2)\n\nCeylon x Schwarz c√≤n real h∆°n c·∫£ ƒë·ªùi t√¥i/Ceylon x Schwarz is more realistic than my life - Sakura",
    "hella": "Hellagur is a self-sufficient DPS-oriented Operator whose damage increases as he loses HP. His first Talent, Waxing Moon, is the engine of his enmity machine, increasing his attack speed significantly at lower HP percentages. His second Talent, Ingenious Strategist, which restores HP over time when he isn't blocking an enemy. This self-healing is important, as he cannot be healed directly by other Operators, but please note that Bard Supporter and Global healing effects like Angelina's talent can heal him\nHellagur's Skills are tailored to increase his DPS in different situations. Skill 1, Crescent Moon, is consistent and automatic, double hit and apply a ATK multiplier. Skill 2, Half Moon, is better for burst needs. Skill 3, Full Moon, turns Hellagur into a multi-target killing machine by extending his range, boosting his attack, and allowing him to hit 3 targets at once.

Armed with an Arts-run flashbulb cannon and a host of flying drones (not snowmen), Magallan operates as a 6* Supporter Summoner unit who calls her drones to the field for Support, Crowd-Control, and DPS. Magallan's kit revolves around her drones. Her first Talent, Support Drone - Soaring Dragon, gives her the ability to summon them, and her second Talent, Optical Refraction Accessories hides her drones from ranged attacks for a short time after they are deployed. What her drones do changes depending on which Skill Magallan has equipped\nIn many ways, Magallan is a very investment-efficient Operator, since investing in her gives you a unit that can cover multiple roles depending on which Skill you choose. However, Magallan's Drones function similarly to other Summoners: each Drone costs DP to deploy and counts toward the Deploy Limit. Magallan's Skills have very powerful effects when activated‚Ä¶ but they also retreat all deployed drones when their duration ends. This is useful because it allows you to shuffle the positions of Magallan's drones throughout a battle, but at high DP and time cost. Also, if a drone is defeated before it can be retreated, that drone is gone for good. Players must time Magallan's Skills carefully: use a Skill too early and the drones retreat right when you need them most, but use a Skill too late and the drones won't be back in time for the next wave.",

Her biggest selling point is probably her low DP cost, making her a cheap source of Arts damage for maps with limited DP. \n\nStats(lvl 30, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 952\nAtk: 340\nDef: 62\nRes: 10\nDP: 12\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 1,6s\n\nRecommended skill: None",
    "f": "As a 2‚òÖ Starter Operator, 12F has no Skills and cannot be promoted. He does gain a Talent upon reaching level 30, though: Dodge Rate Up, which grants an enormous amount of passive Physical Dodge. Combined with his surprisingly high HP (even without promotion, his HP is higher than some 3‚òÖ Casters at max level), 12F can be unexpectedly survivable, especially if you stack additional sources of Physical Dodge on him from other Operators.\nAs an AoE Caster, 12F's role is to do damage, usually to counter huge waves of weak enemies, and despite his purely defensive Talent and lack of promotion, his DPS is often sufficient to get the job done in the early game. As a 2‚òÖ unit, he also benefits from low DP cost (high DP cost is a drawback for most AoE Casters) and cheap upgrade costs, causing some Doctors to choose him over his higher-rarity, higher-DPS counterpart Lava.\n\nStats(lvl 30, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 1378\nAtk: 400\nDef: 50\nRes: 10\nDP: 24\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 70s\nAtkspd: 2,9s\n\nRecommended skill: None",

    "lancet": "This medical A.I. can't understand why humans seem to find her rounded design and her pessimistic attitude to be endearing qualities. As far as she's concerned, her only usefulness is born from her role as Rhodes Island's 1‚òÖ Robot Medic.\nEven if she is correct in her assessment, being a Robot Medic in Arknights is enough to give Lancet-2 several interesting and useful qualities. When deployed, Lancet-2 immediately uses her Talent, Support Spray, which restores HP to all Operators on the battlefield. Since she has an extremely cheap DP cost and does not count toward the Deploy Limit, her Talent can provide emergency healing in any situation at a moment's notice. To make up for this, she has a very long redeployment time.\n\nStats(lvl 30, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 435\nAtk: 70\nDef: 27\nRes: 0\nDP: 3\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 200s\nAtkspd: 2,85s\n\nRecommended skill: None",
    "castle_3": "One of the mechanical mascots of Rhodes Island, Castle-3 has been programmed to do two things: to adore ‚ÄúMaster Closure‚Äù above all others, and to help the Doctor as a 1‚òÖ Robot Guard.\nLike fellow Robot Lancet-2, Castle-3 works by different rules than most Operators. He does not count against Unit Limit when deployed on the field, but he has an extremely long Redeploy Time. He cannot be promoted, and he has no Skills. His value lies in his Talent, Tactical Configuration, which buffs the ATK and DEF of all melee Operators for a short time when he is deployed. Deploying Castle-3 at an opportune moment can allow your Operators to defeat waves that might otherwise overwhelm them.\n\nStats(lvl 30, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 1191\nAtk: 353\nDef: 90\nRes: 0\nDP: 3\nBlock: 1\nRedeploy time: 200s\nAtkspd: 1,5s\n\nRecommended skill: None",
    "thrm": "Another casualty of ‚ÄúMaster Closure's‚Äù campaign to brainwash Rhodes Island's robots into adoring her unconditionally, Thermal-EX is a 1‚òÖ Robot Specialist who specializes in, well‚Ä¶ blowing himself the hell up.Like the other Robots in Arknights, Thermal-EX works a little differently from human Operators. Robots don't count toward the Unit Limit when deployed, but they have extremely long redeployment timers. In addition, they have no Skills and cannot promote; their power comes primarily from their Talents. Thermal-EX's Talent is called Delayed Detonation. I think you can see where this is heading.\n\nStats(lvl 30, not include trust bonuses, modules upgrades and potentials):\nHP: 1443\nAtk: 260\nDef: 443\nRes: 50\nDP: 3\nBlock: 0\nRedeploy time: 200s\nAtkspd: 0,93s\n\nRecommended skill: None"
